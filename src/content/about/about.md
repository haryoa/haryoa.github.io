title: About Me
---

I am a PhD student in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), supervised by Dr. [Alham Fikri Aji](https://afaji.github.io/) and Prof. [Thamar Solorio](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/thamar-solorio/). 

Before my PhD, I had an opportunity to work in industry and do some projects as a Software Engineer, gaining skill in full-stack development and DevOps. Consequently, I can bridge the gap between theoretical advances and practical implementations.

I have experience in text style transfer, efficiency, and data construction, with current interests focusing on efficiency, data, and explainability in NLP, specifically:

- How to improve model learning? (e.g., curriculum learning, knowledge distillation, and creating novel objective functions)
- How do models learn effectively, and what do they learn? (Interpretability)
- What data should be used to enhance model performance (e.g., data selection and synthesis), and how can we create robust and holistic evaluation datasets to assess models (data creation)?


<!-- I'm kind of a "T-shaped" person, where I dive deep into NLP efficiency while learning broadly across Machine Learning fields like Computer Vision, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning. I believe this helps me come up with more creative ideas and be adaptive. -->
